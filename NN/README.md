A simple yet powerful neural network implementation from scratch using NumPy. This repository contains a fully customizable neural network designed for classification tasks, trained on a spiral dataset for demonstration.
 Key Features

Pure NumPy Implementation â€“ No deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow/PyTorch) required.
Flexible Architecture â€“ Supports customizable hidden layers and activation functions.
Training & Evaluation â€“ Implements forward/backward propagation, cross-entropy loss, and L2 regularization.
Visualization â€“ Includes Matplotlib plots to visualize training data and decision boundaries.
How It Works

    Forward Propagation: Computes predictions using ReLU (hidden layer) and Softmax (output).

    Backpropagation: Updates weights via gradient descent.

    Loss Calculation: Uses Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) for multi-class classification.

    Regularization: Adds L2 penalty to prevent overfitting.
